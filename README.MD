# Data Structures and Algorithms

## 1. Data Structures

Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Here are some common data structures:

- **Array**: A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. Example: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- **Linked List**: A sequence of elements where each element (node) contains a value and a reference to the next node.
- **Stack**: A data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. Example: managing function calls.
- **Queue**: A data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Example: processing tasks in order of arrival.
- **Hash Table**: A data structure that stores data in key-value pairs, allowing for fast data retrieval based on a key.
- **Tree**: A hierarchical data structure with a root node and child nodes. Examples include binary trees and binary search trees.
- **Graph**: A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting pairs of nodes.

### Additional Data Structures

- Binary Search Trees
- Heaps
- Tries
- Union Find

## 2. Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or formulas for solving problems. Here are some common algorithms:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Techniques for arranging data in a particular order. Examples include Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Bubble Sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Techniques for finding specific data. Examples include Binary Search and Linear Search.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Techniques for working with graphs, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest path.

### Additional Algorithms

- Bit Manipulation
- Tree Traversal (InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder)
- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- Topological Sort
- Minimum Spanning Tree
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Greedy Algorithms
- Backtracking

## 3. Complexity Analysis

Complexity analysis helps evaluate the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space.

### Time Complexity

Measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, often expressed using Big O notation (O-notation). Common time complexities include:

- O(1): Constant time
- O(n): Linear time
- O(log n): Logarithmic time
- O(n^2): Quadratic time

### Space Complexity

Measures the amount of memory an algorithm requires. Also expressed using Big O notation.

## Examples

1. Searching in an Array:
   - Linear Search: O(n)
   - Binary Search: O(log n)

2. Sorting an Array:
   - Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
   - Merge Sort: O(n log n)
